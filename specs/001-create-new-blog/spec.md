# Feature Specification: Create New Blog Post: Devlog 2

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-new-blog`  
**Created**: Monday, September 15, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create one new blog post for my Next.js site as a single file at src/app/blog/tech/devlog-2-violence-of-action.mdx. We can call it "Devlog 2". Use the existing MDX template style and fill `export const metadata` with: title, slug, date (YYYY-MM-DD), author "Mathew 'Gitchegumi' Lindholm", description, category (faith|life|opinion|tech), tags, and featureImage (/images/blog/<slug>.png). Write ~1200‚Äì1600 words in my site‚Äôs voice with short paragraphs, no em dashes, and tasteful subheads. Do not modify or create any other files‚Äîonly that MDX file."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a site owner, I want to create a new blog post titled "Devlog 2" in the 'tech' category, following the existing MDX template and content guidelines, so that I can publish new content on my Next.js site.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** the site owner wants to create a new blog post, **When** the new MDX file `src/app/blog/tech/devlog-2-violence-of-action.mdx` is created with the specified metadata and content, **Then** the blog post is ready for review and publication.
2.  **Given** the new blog post MDX file is created, **When** the `export const metadata` block is filled with `title: "Devlog 2"`, `slug: "devlog-2-violence-of-action"`, `date: "YYYY-MM-DD"`, `author: "Mathew 'Gitchegumi' Lindholm"`, `description`, `category: "tech"`, `tags`, and `featureImage: "/images/blog/devlog-2-violence-of-action.png"`, **Then** the post's metadata is correctly structured.
3.  **Given** the content of the blog post, **When** it adheres to the site's voice, is between 1200-1600 words, uses short paragraphs, no em dashes, and tasteful subheads, **Then** the content meets the stylistic requirements.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the specified `featureImage` path does not exist? The system will use the provided path as-is; creation or validation of the image file is outside the scope of this feature.
- How does the system handle missing `description` or `tags` in the metadata? The system expects `description` and `tags` to be provided as part of the input for the `export const metadata` block. If not provided, the metadata will be incomplete.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST create a new MDX file at `src/app/blog/tech/devlog-2-violence-of-action.mdx`.
- **FR-002**: The new MDX file MUST follow the existing MDX template style.
- **FR-003**: The `export const metadata` block in the new MDX file MUST include `title`, `slug`, `date` (in YYYY-MM-DD format), `author` ("Mathew 'Gitchegumi' Lindholm"), `description`, `category` ("tech"), `tags`, and `featureImage` (`/images/blog/<slug>.png`).
- **FR-004**: The content of the blog post MUST be between 1200 and 1600 words.
- **FR-005**: The content MUST be written in the site's voice, using short paragraphs, no em dashes, and tasteful subheads.
- **FR-006**: No other files MUST be modified or created.
- **FR-007**: The content of the blog post MUST be informed by all relevant information provided within the `extra-documentation\001-develop-unit-selection` directory (e.g., `spec.md`, `research.md`, `tasks.md`, etc.).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Blog Post**: Represents a single article on the site, identified by its MDX file.
  - Attributes: title, slug, date, author, description, category, tags, featureImage, content.
