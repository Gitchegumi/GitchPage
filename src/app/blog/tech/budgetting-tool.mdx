I built this budgeting tool for the same reason I built DebtPipe.

I was not satisfied with what already exists.

Most budgeting apps fall into one of two camps. They either overcomplicate everything with dashboards, gamification, subscriptions, and features I do not need. Or they oversimplify things so much that they remove the analytical clarity that actually matters.

I do not need confetti when I categorize a transaction.  
I also do not need a toy interface that hides the math.

What I want is structure.

## The Problem With Existing Tools

A lot of budgeting software is built to retain users, not to empower them.

That usually means:

- Recurring subscription fees  
- Backend infrastructure  
- Account aggregation  
- Ongoing operational costs  
- A push toward “engagement” rather than clarity  

If a tool depends on servers, databases, and third-party integrations, someone has to pay for that. That cost eventually lands on the user.

I did not want that.

I wanted something that runs entirely in the browser. No accounts. No logins. No servers. No monthly fee.

Just logic and math.

## Clear, Not Cute

I am highly analytical. I do not need a tool to guess what I am trying to do. I need it to show me the structure of my money in a way that is precise and actionable.

This budgeting tool focuses on:

- Monthly inflow versus outflow  
- Clear category allocation  
- Immediate visibility into surplus or deficit  
- Exportable data  

Nothing hidden. Nothing abstracted away.

It shows what is happening. That is it.

## Built Like DebtPipe

DebtPipe exists because spreadsheets were limiting. Not because I could not do the math in my head, but because the structure was rigid and the visibility was poor.

This budgeting tool follows the same philosophy:

- Clear inputs  
- Deterministic outputs  
- Transparent logic  
- No hidden automation  

It is a tool, not a platform.

It does not try to be your financial therapist. It does not try to replace discipline with features.

It gives you the structure so you can make decisions.

## No Backend. No Cost. No Catch.

Both this budgeting tool and DebtPipe are static web applications.

There is:

- No backend server  
- No database  
- No account system  
- No infrastructure cost  

Everything runs locally in your browser. If you upload a CSV, it never leaves your machine. If you export an Excel file, it is generated client-side.

Because there is no ongoing cost to operate these tools, I can offer them for free.

Not free as in freemium.  
Free as in there is nothing to charge for.

That matters to me.

## Why This Approach Matters

When tools depend on subscriptions, they eventually drift toward feature expansion. More dashboards. More integrations. More “insights.”

I am not trying to build the next fintech startup.

I am building tools I want to use.

Clear inputs. Clear outputs. No noise.

If it helps someone else get control of their finances without paying a monthly fee for the privilege, even better.

That is the whole point.
