Debt calculators are everywhere. Most of them look clean, simple, and reassuring.

They also break down the moment your financial life stops being simple, or you need just a little more information.

[DebtPipe](https://gitchegumi.com/debtpipe) exists because of that gap.

Not because debt snowball calculators are a new idea. They're not. But because the ones I found didn't reflect how debt actually behaves in the real world, especially if your household doesn't fit into a neat, idealized model.

And frankly, most of us don't.

I know mine doesn't.

## Why I Built DebtPipe

When I started seriously modeling debt payoff scenarios, I ran into the same problems over and over:

Some tools limited the number of debts you could enter.
Some hid key details behind simplified summaries.
Some assumed every payment happened exactly as planned, every single month.
Some were contained in complicated Excel spreadsheets.

And almost none of them let you interact with reality as it unfolded.

Because in real life:

You pay some bills early.
You miss others.
You pay extra sometimes.
You pay less other times.
And occasionally, you throw a one-off payment at something just to make progress.

Debt isn't static. It's dynamic.

[DebtPipe](https://gitchegumi.com/debtpipe) was built to reflect that.

## What Makes DebtPipe Different?

[DebtPipe](https://gitchegumi.com/debtpipe) started as a standard snowball/avalanche calculator, but it quickly evolved into something much more interactive.

[DebtPipe](https://gitchegumi.com/debtpipe) lets you model your actual debts using your real balances, interest rates, and payment strategy. But unlike other calculators, the timeline isn't frozen in place.

It responds to you.

[DebtPipe](https://gitchegumi.com/debtpipe) allows you to:

- Click on individual debts for a specific month and mark them as paid
- Apply one-time payment overrides without permanently changing your baseline plan
- See remaining balances and payoff timelines update immediately
- Track how your monthly cash flow changes as debts are paid off
- Persist your progress locally so your state survives reloads and navigation (and you don't share your data with anyone)
- Export a clean PDF to share with your spouse or significant other (the real reason I did all this is so I can share our progress with my wife)

This matters because once a debt is paid off, that payment becomes fuel for the next one. The snowball grows. Things start to accelerate. And DebtPipe shows you that progression clearly.

It also allows you to model real-world behavior without corrupting the math. One-time payments reduce balances without artificially inflating the snowball pool.

## Built Around Interaction, Not Static Projections

Most calculators show you a theoretical outcome.

[DebtPipe](https://gitchegumi.com/debtpipe) lets you live inside the timeline.

You can interact directly with each debt instance in each month. Toggle payments. Override amounts. Watch downstream balances recalculate instantly. Every change carries forward through the timeline.

[DebtPipe](https://gitchegumi.com/debtpipe) tracks each payment and recalculates balances, payoff milestones, and flow automatically.

[DebtPipe](https://gitchegumi.com/debtpipe) also tracks “flow remaining,” which shows how much debt remains in the pipeline each month as payments are marked complete.

This gives you situational awareness so you can see where you've been and what's coming next.

## Real-World Features That Actually Matter

[DebtPipe](https://gitchegumi.com/debtpipe) includes functionality that many calculators either omit or oversimplify:

Unlimited debts. No artificial caps.

One-time payment overrides that don't distort your snowball.

Per-month payment tracking so you can reflect reality instead of fantasy.

Your progress is saved locally, so reloads don't wipe everything out.

Monthly flow tracking so you understand how your financial breathing room changes over time.

Export a clean payoff schedule when you need it.

No need to download any software, everything is done in the browser. Your data is not shared with anyone.

You can even type your debts directly into the app if you don't want to download and use the optional CSV template.

These features are what I felt was missing from other debt calculators that I found online.

## Built Iteratively, Designed for Accuracy

[DebtPipe](https://gitchegumi.com/debtpipe) wasn't built in a single pass. It was built incrementally as I ran into real problems and fixed them.

Key improvements included:

- Adding interactive bill tracking and flow monitoring
- Supporting custom payments and dynamic timeline recalculation
- Allowing one-off payments and month-specific flow tracking without breaking snowball logic

The result is a tool that responds to what you do instead of forcing you to accept a static projection.

## Why DebtPipe Exists

[DebtPipe](https://gitchegumi.com/debtpipe) exists because financial modeling shouldn't assume perfection.

It shouldn't assume you have five debts or fewer.

It shouldn't assume every payment happens exactly as planned.

And it definitely shouldn't hide the mechanics that determine how quickly you get out of debt.

[DebtPipe](https://gitchegumi.com/debtpipe) shows you exactly what's happening and lets you seize control of your debt.

Not to make debt look easy.

But to make progress visible.
